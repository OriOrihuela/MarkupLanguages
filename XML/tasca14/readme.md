# Creation of an exam with autocorrect (XML + JavaScript)
***With the following instructions:***
1. Create a web page with 10 questions with at least 5 different types of `form` elements.
2. Create an `XML` file that contains the title of the questions, the options to respond (*if any*) and the correct answers.
3. Encode `JavaScript` to give an automated correction to the exam (*the JavaScript compares the answers entered in the form with the
correct answers in the file*).
4. `Form` elements with multiple option (*select multiple and checkbox*) must have more than one correct answer.

## Build a web application that presents a set of questions properly to all kind of devices, it has to be elegant and may be 
autocorrected (*with a single button to correct*).

***Things to do with the application:***

1. Have a presentation and instructions (*they may be in the same page*).
2. Read the data of an `xml` file (*title, type of question, options i answers*) and present them.
3. Correct only if you have completed all the questions (*use the attribute required and / or others that you will have to look for*).
4. Correct and submit a note (*optionally, it will be presented which options you answered well and what bad*).    
**Other optional properties:**
5. *Maximum exam time* of completion.
6. Any personal proposal that is made once everything works...
